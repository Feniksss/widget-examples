# CloudSponge Examples
This is a public library of fully functional examples of the CloudSponge widget. You can deploy any of these html files into your `localhost` environment to start tinkering around with the product.

## basic.html
The simplest way to integrate the CloudSponge widget is to add an anchor tag with the <code>cs_import</code> class somewhere on your page.

## deep-links.html
You can skip the main menu and let your users go straight to the contact source that they want by adding these deep links to your page.

Most people replace these text links with graphics. You can <a href="http://www.cloudsponge.com/img/developer/icon-set.zip">download some icons here</a> if you don't have your own set.
